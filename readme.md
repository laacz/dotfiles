# My dotfiles 

It's that time. I've lived long enough without dotfiles. Not a huge fan of mega customizations, but I do like to have a few things set up the way I like them.

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
git clone https://github.com/laacz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh 
```

Could have made it private, but then cloning onto boxes without a github token
would be a pain.
