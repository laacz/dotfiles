description: Catch up with changes in current branch vs main
allowed-tools: Bash(git:*)
---

Help me catch up with the current state of work by:

1. Getting the list of changed files: `git diff main...HEAD --name-only`
2. Getting the diff summary: `git diff main...HEAD --stat`
3. Reading all changed files
4. Providing a concise summary of:
   - What files changed and why
   - What the changes accomplish
   - Current state of the work
   - Potential next steps

Focus on giving me context to continue working effectively.
